#Feature Representation
**Q1.** What is the effect of correlation between two features on the feature space representation?

**Q2.** Is it possible that the addition of a new feature decrease the accuracy of the NN classifier? How?

**Q3.** Is it correct that for nearest neighbor classifier, it is always best to have all features scaled to the same range? Show why or give a counter example.

**Q4.** Can the nearest neighbor classifier be applied to feature vectors of different length? Is it possible to do so if you have a function that takes in two feature vectors (possibly of different lengths), and outputs the similarity/distance between them? Suggest a possible function of this nature, and a classification problem, where it can be applied.
