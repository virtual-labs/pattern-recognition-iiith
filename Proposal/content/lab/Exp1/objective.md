#Feature Representation
The high level goals of the experiment are:

1.  To understand the role of feature extraction as a filter of information and the effect of this filtering process on our ability to classify.
2.  To understand the effect of various types of features on the distribution of points in feature space.
3.  To generate your own feature set by combining existing set of features, or defining new ones.
4.  To appreciate the appropriateness of different feature sets to different classification problems.
